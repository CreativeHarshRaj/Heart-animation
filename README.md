# Heart-animation
This neon heart animation website is something pretty cool, I think, with this heart made out of glowing blue and pink lines that move around. It has this chaser effect where the light trails behind, giving it a sense of motion, and theres an overall glow that makes the whole page feel alive. I like how its built just with HTML, CSS, and some JS, no extra stuff needed.

The heart itself is stylized, pulsing against a dark background that gradients into something futuristic. It works well on phones or computers too, which is nice for showing off.

Features wise, theres the animated heart with those curves in blue and pink. The chaser adds depth, sort of trailing smoothly. And the ambient glow spreads across the page, making it richer visually. Its all handcoded, clean.

Previewing it, the screenshot shows the heart beating with that romantic yet sci-fi vibe. That part stands out, how it combines glow and movement without being too busy. I might be missing some details here, but it seems perfect for a portfolio or landing page.
